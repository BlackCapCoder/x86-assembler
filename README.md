I wrote this over a summer at a cabin without internet access- through guesswork, reverse engineering and brute force.
It supports a large subset of x86, but VEX notably is missing.


I've tried to work on it since, but you have no idea how convoluted x86 is until you try writing an assembler!


The Intel manual is like 11 volumes (the best one is volume 2).
The first chapter is great, and the rest are exceptions to the previous chapters.
Every so often you'll get a "there are some exceptions" with no explanation at all.
