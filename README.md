I wrote this over a summer at a remote cabin without internet access through guesswork, reverse engineering and brute force.
It supports a large subset of x86, but VEX notably is missing.


I've tried to work on it since through the power of internet, but you have no idea how convoluted x86
is until try writing an assembler!


The Intel manual is like 11 volumes (but the best one is volume 2), and
the first chapter is great, then the rest are exceptions to the previous ones.
Every so often you'll get a "there are some exceptions" with no explanation at all.
